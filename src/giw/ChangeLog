* Tue Sep 11, 2007 -- James Scott <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Public release version 0.2.4
 
  FranÃ§ois Galea provided a patch to fix one bug 
  and solved some Glib warnings when using giwxyplot.
  The bug:
  giwxyplot:190
  -    g_object_unref(xyplot->back_gc);
  +    g_object_unref(xyplot->data_gc);

  The warnings:
  *somehow, at program end, giw_xyplot_destroy is called twice for each 
  created giwxyplot. Maybe there is a smarter solution, but setting all 
  unreferenced object pointers to NULL solves the problem.
 
  *gdk_draw_lines was called even if data is not available.
 
* Sat Feb 3, 2007 -- James Scott <skoona@users.sourceforge.net>
- Public release version 0.2.3
- Removed -ansi -pedantic from compile cflags, this broke the compile mainly
  from the use of // as a comment prefix.
- fixup the makefile for the library or build directory
  changed each *.c file to include its header using <header.h>
  verus double-quotes.  This is a runtime benefit for the package.
- Added -soname and -version-info to configure.in to enable
  changing library version info from the config scripts, also updated
  makefile.am in the build dir to pickup these values.
- Changed makefile.am to include the source of all example programs
  in a binary install, by placing them into /usr/local/doc/giw/*.c
- Added some install text to README file.  I will need to combace to this doc later.  
- Created an rpm of the library giw-0.2.3-fc6.{i686,src}.rpm
