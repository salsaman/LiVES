GIW - GTK INSTRUMENTATION WIDGETS

1- GENERAL
  The GIW is a library with widgets for instrumentation applications, or any kind of 
  scientific application. The available widgets can display and receive data in various 
  forms. Those widgets were built using the GTK library.
  
  GIW is hosted at http://tesla.eletrica.ufpr.br/giw
  GIW's sourceforge page in http://giw.sourceforge.net/
  GTK is hosted at http://www.gtk.org 
  
2- HOW TO USE
  GIW was developed to be used in two different ways.
  
  1. Inline
  	- you compile the widget.c and widget.h source as another source member of your
  	  regular gtk project.
  
  2. Shared Library
  	- You install the shared library 
  	  (and plan to distribute the shared library with you project)
  	- Add the "#include <giw.h> " to source files which reference gwi
  	- Add the "giw" to the pkg-config statement in your makefile
  	  * example "pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-2.0 giw"
 
3- INSTALLATION 
  unpack the source tarball
  $ ./configure         {--enable-gtk-doc may be needed, if you have gtk-doc installed}
  $ make clean all
  $ sudo make install   (as root user)
  
  or install the source rpm and build binaries:
  -- $ rpm -ivh giw-<release>.src.rpm
     $ cd /usr/src/redhat/SPECS
     $ rpmbuild -ba --target i686 giw.spec
     $ cd /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i686
     ... then install binary

  or install the binary rpm : 
  -- $ rpm -ivh giw-<release>.i686.rpm
  
  libgiw.so, giw.h, giw.pc is now installed in /usr/{lib/giw, include/giw, lib/pkgconfig}
  html documentation files are in /usr/share/doc/giw
  devhelp documentation automatically loaded, just start devhelp '$ devhelp'
  
  to compile a sample.c program that uses this library, do:
  $ gcc -Wall -g -O2 `pkg-config --cflags --libs giw` -o sample_out sample.c
  
  where: sample.c is your gtk based program source file
  giw samples have been compiled and placed into /usr/bin/ as giw_*_simple giw_*_full
  with sources installed in /usr/share/doc/giw/*.c
  
  note: giw drags gtk+-2.0 and glib-2.0 with it; when using pkg-config
  - try: $ pkg-config --cflags giw
    compared to $ pkg-config --cflags gtk+-2.0
    -- if it fails, try: $ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$PKG_CONFIG_PATH:/usr/lib/pkgconfig
    --                   $ pkg-config --cflags giw
