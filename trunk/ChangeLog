Czech language support was added, thanks to Ales Zemene.

Some minor RFX fixes - active widget is remembered between calls to effects.
Fixed some build errors in build-lives-rfx-plugin
Made the init trigger a "heavyweight" trigger, i.e. it can call subroutines in 
smogrify. Fixed error handling in pre/loop/post/init_trigger and documented same.

Fixed various trigger problems in RFX builder. Added move up/down for parameter 
window hints.

Some changes were made to handle non-Perl encoder plugins. Added support for the

effect plugins from scripts.
Converted all LiVES rendered effects and some tools to plugins. Optimised the
rendered effects, and fixed a few minor glitches in them.

despeckle, emboss, remove subtitles (thanks Marco; requires python2.3)

Split encoding/effects tabs in Preferences. Added a new pref
'antialias'.
Removed 'effects command' from preferences and ~/.lives as it is no
longer necessary.

structures. Created functions to generate parameter windows from a
lives_rendered_effect_t and g_list's of window hints and triggers.

Started implementing the new 'Advanced' menu.
Made the effects/tools/advanced|run test rfx menu entry be dynamically
generated.

Created RFX builder window (still some rough edges...)

Fixed some file close ommisions (oops) !

      new architecture.

      (still in progress).

'Preview' appropriately.

format !! Thanks :-)
Only check encoder audio restrictions if we are encoding with audio.
