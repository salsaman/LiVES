Installation (binary versions)

for more information.





INSTALLING FROM SOURCE
----------------------------------------------------
If you got LiVES as a tar.gz or tar.bz2, at a terminal prompt, enter the following:


          bzip2 -d LiVES-2.6.5.tar.bz2
or,
          gzip -d LiVES-2.6.5.tar.gz

depending on which version you have. Then:


          tar xvf LIVES-2.6.5.tar

          cd lives-2.6.5



now type:
	./configure

check the output of configure very carefully, following any advice it provides, 
and making any adjustments you may wish - such as installing optional libraries.

If you are happy with the output from configure, then compile the source with:

	make


again, check the output for any warnings or errors.


Assuming everything went OK, you can now install the application with:

	make install

(you probably need to do this as root - on some systems you would become root using "su", on other systems you would run

	sudo make install

)


Finally, you should make sure your system can find the new libraries installed by LiVES:

	sudo ldconfig






You can then run lives either from a menu, or by typing in a terminal:


        lives








Relocating:
-----------
The default location for everything is inside /usr; so executables go in /usr/bin, themes and scripts in /usr/share/lives/, and libraries and compiled plugins in /usr/lib.


  When installing from source, you can change this with:
        ./configure --prefix=/some/other/dir


  You can also install in a non-default directory with:
	make install DESTDIR=/some/other/dir



However, if you do relocate, and this is not a fresh install, you will need to edit your .lives file in your home directory and adjust <prefix_dir> and <lib_dir> so that they point to the correct locations for scripts and plugins.

NOTE: if the library directory is anything except /usr/lib, you should adjust the libraries in libweed pkg-config files:
libweed/*.pk






Other configuration options
---------------------------

For a complete list of configure options, type:

	./configure --help




Troubleshooting
---------------
Make sure you have themes and icons, and plugins installed as above.
If they are moved from their installed location, make sure you edit <prefix_dir> and <lib_dir>
in ~/.lives

In case of any problems, check your ~/.lives file and make sure everything is 
pointing to the right locations.

You can also try deteleting your ~/.lives file. LiVES will recreate this with default settings 
on the next start up.


Make sure there is plenty of space available in the temporary directory
(default is /tmp/livestmp).
It is advisable to change the temp directory from Tools | Preferences | Directories


Run through Help -> Troubleshoot in the app and see if anything is missing.


If you are having problems encoding, make sure you have everything you need 
installed. The plugins are just interfaces, and you need to have the binaries 
installed also. Some of the encoder formats have other dependencies, the LiVES website has more details.




Problems opening files
----------------------
If you have problems opening a particular video file, try to preview
it first in the 'open file' dialogue. If you cannot preview it, it means mplayer is not 
compiled to open it. You may need to recompile mplayer for your system
with extra libraries.

Note that current versions of LiVES no longer require mplayer to open some file types. For example dv format 
can be opened with libdv and the dv_decoder plugin. Ogg/theora can be opened with libogg and libtheora.



If you are having problems opening video, edit /usr/bin/smogrify, and near the top put:
$DEBUG_OPEN=1;
you will then see the mplayer open command on the console, which can
be cut and pasted into a terminal window.

Finally, if you are still having problems, join the lives-video
mailing list and you can ask your question there !
