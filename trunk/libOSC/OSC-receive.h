/**************************************************
   Initialization and memory pre-allocation
 **************************************************/

/* The memory model used by this module is pre-allocation of fixed-size
  objects for network buffers and other internal objects.  This preallocated
  memory is dynamically managed internally by a custom high-performance memory
  allocator.  When the preallocated memory runs out, this module calls an
  optional realtime memory allocator that you provide.  If your memory
  allocator gives this module more memory, it will add it to the pool of
  objects and never free the memory.  If your system does not have a realtime
  memory allocator, provide a procedure that always returns 0.

  You will fill an OSCReceiveMemoryTuner struct with the parameters that
  determine how memory will be allocated.

  The MemoryAllocator fields are procedures you will provide that allocate
  memory.  Like malloc(), they take the number of bytes as arguments and return
  either a pointer to the new memory or 0 for failure.  This memory will never
  be freed.

- The InitTimeMemoryAllocator will be called only at initialization time,
  i.e., before OSCInitAddressSpace() returns.  If it ever returns 0, that's
  a fatal error.

- The RealTimeMemoryAllocator will be called if, while the application is
  running, the address space grows larger than can fit in what was allocated
  at initialization time.  If the RealTimeMemoryAllocator() returns 0, the
  operation attempting to grow the address space will fail.  If your system
  does not have real-time memory allocation, RealTimeMemoryAllocator should
  be a procedure that always returns 0.

  The remaining fields say how much memory to allocate at initialization time:

- receiveBufferSize is the maximum packet size that can be received.  Is the
  maximum UDP packet size 4096?  OSC clients can send a query to this system
  asking for this maximum packet size.

- numReceiveBuffers determines how many packets at a time can be sitting
  on the scheduler with messages waiting to take effect.  If all the
  receive buffers are tied up like this, you won't be able to receive
  new packets.

- numQueuedObjects is the number of messages and packets that can be sitting
  on the scheduler waiting to take effect.

- Because a message pattern may be dispatched before the message takes effect,
  we need memory to store the callback pointers corresponding to a message.
  numCallbackListNodes is the number of callbacks that may be stored in this
  fashion.  It must be at least as large as the maximum number of methods that
  any one message pattern may match, but if you want to take advantage of
  pre-dispatching, this should be large enough to hold all the callbacks for
  all the messages waiting in the scheduler.
